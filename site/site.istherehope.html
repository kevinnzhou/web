      Is There Hope?
    </h2>
  <p>Yes! There is hope! We finally have a decent head coach who's actually motivated to improving the franchise.
  We also have many promising talents such as RJ Barret, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, etc.
  These players have led us to the 6th best defensive reating in the league.
  With our solid bench and a positive attitude, who knows how far we'll go?</p>
