  <h2>
    Reasons Why the Knicks Suck
    </h2>
  <p>1. We haven't had a season where we had more wins than losses since 2013.</p>
  <p>2. Our coaches suck (but maybe not Coach Thibs).</p>
  <p>3. Traded away fan-favorite Jeremy Lin. One of our key pieces to our future. Just because Carmelo Anthony was a greedy #!$%@$#@</p>
  <p>4. We can't even tank properly. We're so bad at everything that we can't even purposely lose games.</p>
  <p>5. James Dolan</p>
  <p>6. Terrible trading. Notably the Eddie Curry trade.</p>
  <p>7. New York is more known for a team that was originally from New Jersey.</p>
  <p>I can go on and on. But I won't <3</p>
