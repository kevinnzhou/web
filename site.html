    <p> This website is dedicated to the love-hate relationship shared among all Knicks fans. This website may offend some diehard Knicks fans, but they're gonna have to deal with it because they won't admit that I'm right</p>

    <p>The New York Knicks (sometimes referred to as the Knickerbockers), are a basketball team based in New York City. Founded in 1946 by Ned Irish, the Knicks officially entered the league in 1949. Unlike the modern-day Knicks, the 1970 Knicks were a solid team. Led by Hall of Famers Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, and Bill Bradley, they made the NBA Finals 3 times and won twice. The Knicks have also drafted many legends such as Dikembe Mutombo, Tracy McGrady, Bernard King, and Patrick Ewing. During the years 1987-2001, the Knicks made the playoffs every time but never won a ring. Thanks Reggie. After this playoff streak, the Knicks would never place above the 6th seed (with the exception of the 2012-2013 season). In the 2014-2015 season, the Knicks had their worst record in franchise history. The following seasons have not been much better, but the 2020-2021 season is looking somewhat promising. As of February 27, 2021, the Knicks have the same record as the Boston Celtics (16-17). They are tied for the 6th seed. This is very surprising given the fact that the Celtics were the third seed last season, and the Knicks were at the 12th seed.
