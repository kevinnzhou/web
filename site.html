    <p> This website is dedicated to the love-hate relationship shared throughout all Knicks fans. This website may offend some diehard Knicks fans, but they're gonna have to deal with it because they won't admit that I'm right</p>

    <p>The New York Knicks (sometimes referred to as the Knickerbockers), are a basketball team based in New York City. Founded in 1946 by Ned Irish, the Knicks officially entered the league in 1949. Unlike the modern-day Knicks, the 1970 Knicks were a solid team. In the decade, they made the NBA Finals 3 times and won twice.
