  <h2>
    Reasons Why the Knicks Suck
    </h2>
      <ol>
  <li>We haven't had a season where we had more wins than losses since 2013.</li>
  <li>Our coaches suck (but maybe not Coach Thibs).</li>
  <li>Let go of fan-favorite Jeremy Lin. One of our key pieces to our future. All because of luxury tax.</li>
  <li>We can't even tank properly. We're so bad at everything that we can't even purposely lose games.</li>
  <li>James Dolan</li>
  <li>Terrible trading. Notably the Eddie Curry trade.</li>
  <li>New York is more known for a team that was originally from New Jersey.</li>
  <li>According to Bleacher Report, over the past 20 seasons, the Knicks were 22nd in points per 100 possessions, 30th in points allowed per 100 possessions and 30th in simple rating system (point differential combined with strength of schedule).</li>
  <li>Expanding on reason 5, the front office in general just sucks.</li>
  <li>Kevin Durant, MVP, 2x Finals MVP, 2x All Star Game MVP, Rookie of the Year, 2x Olympic Gold Medalist, and undoubtedly a future Hall of Famer on why superstars won't join the Knicks: "Fans expect players to join the Knicks because of their brand but players have grown up watching the Knicks suck and they aren’t cool anymore.”</li>
      </ol>

    <p> These Knicks fans are ashamed of their team. At the time that this picture was taken, the Knicks had an atrocious record of 5-33.</p>
