  <h2>
    Reasons Why the Knicks Suck
    </h2>
      <ol>
  <li>We haven't had a season where we had more wins than losses since 2013.</li>
  <li>Our coaches suck (but maybe not Coach Thibs).</li>
  <li>Traded away fan-favorite Jeremy Lin. One of our key pieces to our future. Just because Carmelo Anthony was a greedy #!$%@$#@</li>
  <li>We can't even tank properly. We're so bad at everything that we can't even purposely lose games.</li>
  <li>James Dolan</li>
  <li>Terrible trading. Notably the Eddie Curry trade.</li>
  <li>New York is more known for a team that was originally from New Jersey.</li>
  <li>I can go on and on. But I won't <3</li>
