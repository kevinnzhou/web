  <h2>Some Decent Things About the Franchise</h2>
  <p>We all know the Knicks suck, but we have to give them a little credit for some things. We've drafted some Hall of Famers</p>
  <p>We've drafted some Hall of Famers such as Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, Bernard King, and Dikembe Mutombo (though he stayed</p>
  <p>with us for only one season. 
  <p>Another notable quality of the Knicks is their fanbase. Imagine being a fan of a team who hasn't been in the playoffs since</p>
  <p>2013 HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAA. You've got to respect some of us. The Knicks can go 0-82 and still have millions of fans defending them.</p>
  
  <h2>Reasons Why the Knicks Suck</h2>
  <p>1. We haven't had a season where we had more wins than losses since 2013.</p>
  <p>2. Our coaches suck (but maybe not Coach Thibs).</p>
  <p>3. Traded away fan-favorite Jeremy Lin. One of our key pieces to our future. Just because Carmelo Anthony was a greedy #!$%@$#@!</p>
  <p>4. 100% not the Knicks fault but we never get top 3 picks despite being at the bottom of the NBA.</p>
  <p>5. James Dolan</p>
  <p>6. Terrible trading. We gave away JR Smith and Iman Shumpert for a bunch of nobodies.</p>
