      Some Decent Things About the Franchise
  </h2>
  <p>
    We all know the Knicks suck, but we have to give them a little credit for some things. We've drafted some Hall of Famers
    They've drafted some Hall of Famers such as Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, Bernard King, and Dikembe Mutombo (though he stayed
    with us for only one season. Also, Carmelo Anthony spent his legendary prime years in New York. </p>
  <p>The Knicks are responsible for producing Linsanity. Jeremy Lin is an Asian-American basketball player who had his best years with the Knicks. During his time with the Knicks, he was sleeping o his friends couch. When he was in threat of being cut from the team, Lin played out of his mind. Against the New Jersey Nets, he put on a show in Madison Square Garden, scoring 25 points and 5 assists out of nowhere. For the next 26 games, Lin would do the same, even against Kobe and his Lakers. Sadly, he would tear his meniscus, putting him on the bench for the rest of the season. When he recovered, he wasn't the same.
    Another notable quality of the Knicks is their fanbase. Knicks fans are by far the most loyal fans in the NBA. Imagine being a fan of a team who hasn't been in the playoffs since
    2013. The Knicks can go 0-82 and still have millions of fans defending them.</p>
