      Is There Hope?
    </h2>
  <p>Yes! There is hope! We finally have a decent head coach who's actually motivated to improving the franchise.
  We also have many promising talents such as RJ Barret, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, etc.
  These players have led us to the 6th best defensive reating in the league. We've showed incredible offensive potential previously as well, scoring 143 points against the Atlanta Hawks. RJ Barret led the Knicks to a 143-120 victory, contributing 27 points, 6 assists, and 5 rebounds. Marcus Morris, Juilius Randle, Mitchell Robinson, Dennis Smith Jr, and Kevin Knox put up above-average numbers that game as well. As of February 27, 2021, we are tied with the Celtics for the 6th seed with a record of 16-17. We also have an all-star on our team now: Julius Randle.
  Personally, with our solid roster and a positive attitude, I genuinely think that we are capable of making the playoffs. Even if we don't do well this season, we'll be in the draft, hoping for a top 3 pick. The Lakers sucked for a few years, and look where they are now. We definitely have some good things coming for us in the coming years.</p>
