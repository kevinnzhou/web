      Some Decent Things About the Franchise
  </h2>
  <p><p style="background-color: #A2CEF1; color: initial;">
    We all know the Knicks suck, but we have to give them a little credit for some things. We've drafted some Hall of Famers
    We've drafted some Hall of Famers such as Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, Bernard King, and Dikembe Mutombo (though he stayed
    with us for only one season.
    Another notable quality of the Knicks is their fanbase. Imagine being a fan of a team who hasn't been in the playoffs since
    2013 HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAA. You've got to respect some of us. The Knicks can go 0-82 and still have millions of fans defending them.</p>

    Reasons Why the Knicks Suck
    </h2>
  <p><p style="background-color: #A2CEF1; color: initial;">
  1. We haven't had a season where we had more wins than losses since 2013.
  2. Our coaches suck (but maybe not Coach Thibs).
  3. Traded away fan-favorite Jeremy Lin. One of our key pieces to our future. Just because Carmelo Anthony was a greedy #!$%@$#@

  4. We can't even tank properly. We're so bad at everything that we can't even purposely lose games.
  5. James Dolan
  6. Terrible trading. Notably the Eddie Curry trade.
  7. New York is more known for a team that was originally from New Jersey.
  I can go on and on. But I won't <3</p>

      Is There Hope?
    </h2>
  <p><p style="background-color: #A2CEF1; color: initial;">
  Yes! There is hope! We finally have a decent head coach who's actually motivated to improving the franchise.
  We also have many promising talents such as RJ Barret, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, etc.

  These players have led us to the 6th best defensive reating in the league.

  With our solid bench and a positive attitude, who knows how far we'll go?</p>
